# The Convergent Billboard

The Convergent Billboard is a bonding curve linked to an advertisement.

## Tell me more...

One token is linked to 24 hours of banner time on our [billboard page](billboard.convergent.cx). 
However, _catch_ is that only the area _underneath_ the curve is available for displaying the banner. 
The more tokens that are bought or sold from the curve the more or less of the advertisement will
be displayed. You are not required to spend your token right away and instead can hold onto them to use later
or sell back to the curve at the determined price at the time based on the total supply of the token.

If you would like to simply buy the ad without worrying about the token, no problem! Simply
hit the `Purchase Ad` button and pay the amount of ether specified. The rest is taken care of
for you behind the scenes.

## Technical Details

The Convergent Billboard is made entirely on the decentralized tech stack, including IPFS and
Ethereum.
